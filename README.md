## About the project.
 I came up with the web app While COVID-19 quarantine in Israel was about to end.

The government released a note that all businesses need to log all the customers visit their business.
My mother's shoe store for example uses a Handwritten log that took precious time. 

The other day, while waiting to enter a store I realize the need for a digital waiting list of customers outside the store, Can help avoid arguments :) 

##### The idea is simple:
- Store owners log in with google and create a store.

- Each store gets a unique id.

- Customers register to store by store id and then fill a short registration form.

- The store owner has a dashboard with an editable log and a Track of the queue outside.
